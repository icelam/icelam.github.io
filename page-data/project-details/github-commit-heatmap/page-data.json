I decided to have a look on the new technology by reading some articles, and I came across the <a href=\"https://developer.github.com/v4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github GraphQL API</a>.</p>\n<p>The first thing came up in my mind was: \"Oh, this is brilliant! I am going to give it a try and build a graph to show statistic of my commit time!\". After 3 hours searching and reading documentations, I build my first GraphQL query.</p>\n<p>I spent another day wrapping the API call using PHP, as Github GraphQL API requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to access, and I want to secure the token. The remaining parts comes to \"How to present the data?\".</p>\n<p>I thought of using bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart, but I feel like I am missing something. By chance, I saw the Github contribution graph. That's what I want!</p>\n<p>That's the whole story why I end up plotting the graph using heatmap.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"3631f870-c255-5d3a-b66d-ec4129fb2976"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
