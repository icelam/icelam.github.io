As a developer who is passionate about cutting edge technology, I am so exited to see how can Deno \"destroy Node.js\".</p>\n<p>I have created a CLI called \"wikipedia-cli\" which you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for Wikipedia page through your terminal</li>\n<li>Get a random Wikipedia page</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Deno community is not mature yet, so there is not much tutorials or examples I can found. I have to went through all the documentations, pull requests and Github issues to find the information I need. Sometimes I even need to dig into the source code to understand how Deno works.</p>\n<p>While integrating with Wikipedia REST API, I discovered a bug in Deno's fetch API, which blocks me from implementing the main feature of this CLI. Unfortunately without knowledge in Rust, I decided to open an issue and wait for the fix to release.</p>\n<p>However the lucky thing is, after opening the issue, it has been fixed and released on the next day, so I was able to complete this CLI within 3 days.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"0479d29c-7abc-5f14-8712-6ae0e6c06795"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
